# HomeKit Gate Controller for Centurion D5-Evo Gate Motor

**HomeKit gate controller for Centurion (Centsys) D5 Evo gate motor**

This project implements a HomeKit-compatible gate controller using an ESP8266 microcontroller and the Arduino-HomeKit-ESP8266 library, specifically designed for Centurion (Centsys) D5-Evo gate motors. It enables remote control and status monitoring of the gate with Apple HomeKit.

## Features
- ✅ **HomeKit Integration:** Seamless control via the Apple Home app using the HomeSpan library.
- ✅ **Gate Control:** Open and close the gate with a relay trigger.
- ✅ **Status Detection:** Real-time detection of gate states (open, closed, opening, closing).
- ✅ **Gate Status** Detects when gate opens/closes from a different source (e.g. remote control, intercom, keypad).

## How It Works
The system uses an ESP8266 microcontroller to manage a relay and monitor the gate's operational state:
- **Relay Control:** The relay pin (GPIO 14) triggers the gate motor.
- **Status Monitoring:** The status pin (GPIO 12) monitors the gate's operation based on pulse patterns sent by the gate controller.
- **Flashing Patterns:** The gate signals its state using pulse patterns, where the duration of HIGH and LOW signals indicates whether the gate is opening or closing.
- **Logic Level Conversion:** A logic level converter is used to shift the gate's 5V status signal to a 3.3V input suitable for the ESP8266.

The `main.ino` class implements:
- `update()` – Triggered by HomeKit to open/close the gate.
- `loop()` – Continuously monitors the gate's state based on the input pin.

## Hardware Requirements
- ESP8266 microcontroller
- Relay module (for gate control)
- Buck Converter (Optional if you want to use another source of power)
- Logic level converter (5V to 3.3V signal conversion on status pin)

## Wiring

### Gate Motor, LLC, Relay Module, Buck Converter, and ESP8266 Connections

#### 1. **Gate Motor to Buck Converter:**
- **Safe COMMON** → **Buck Converter IN-** (Use ground from gate motor for isolation).
- **+12V Out** → **Buck Converter IN+** (12V output for buck converter input).
  
#### 2. **Gate Motor to Relay Module:**
- **COM (Gate Motor)** → **Relay COM** (Trigger input for gate motor, activated by relay).
- **TRIG** → **Relay NO** (Trigger input for gate motor, connected to Normally Open terminal of relay).

#### 3. **Gate Motor Status to LLC:**
- **Status (Gate Motor)** → **LLC HV IN** (5V status output connected to high-voltage side of LLC).

#### 4. **LLC Connections:**
- **HV [1-4]** → **Gate Motor Status** (Status signal from gate motor to LLC).
- **HV** → **Buck Converter OUT+** (High-voltage side powered by 5V from buck converter).
- **GND (Next to HV)** → **Buck Converter OUT-** (Negative terminal of buck converter).
- **LV** → **ESP8266 3.3V** (Low-voltage side, powered by ESP8266).
- **GND (Next to LV)** → **ESP8266 GND** (Common ground for ESP8266 and LLC).
- **LV [1-4]** → **ESP8266 GPIO 12** (Converted 3.3V logic signal to GPIO 12 for monitoring gate status).

#### 5. **Relay Module to ESP8266:**
- **IN** → **ESP8266 GPIO 14** (Control signal from GPIO 14, triggering relay).
- **NO** → **Gate Motor TRIG** (Normally Open terminal to trigger gate motor).
- **COM** → **Gate COM** (Connected to the gate COM for isolation).
- **VCC** → **Buck Converter 5V** (Power for relay module).
- **GND** → **Common Ground** (Shared ground for all components).

#### 6. **Buck Converter to Power Sources:**
- **VIN (+)** → **Gate Motor +12V Out** (12V input from gate motor to buck converter).
- **VOUT (-)** → **LLC HV GND**, **Relay GND** (5V ground output).
- **VOUT (+)** → **ESP8266 Power**, **LLC HV**, **Relay VCC** (5V output for powering ESP8266 and other components).
- **VIN (-)** → **Common Ground** (Shared ground).

#### 7. **ESP8266 to LLC and Relay Module:**
- **GND** → **Common Ground** (Shared ground).
- **3.3V** → **LLC LV** (Power for low-voltage side of LLC).
- **5V** → **Relay VCC**, **LLC HV** (Power for relay and LLC if not using buck converter).
- **GPIO 14** → **Relay IN** (Control signal to relay).
- **GPIO 12** → **LLC LV OUT** (Status signal from LLC converted from gate motor status).
                                                 |

**Notes:**

* **Common Ground:** All components share a common ground connection possibly in a .
* **Buck Converter:** The buck converter efficiently steps down the 12V from the gate motor to 5V (and potentially 3.3V) for the other components.
* **LLC:** The logic level converter ensures compatibility between the 5V gate status signal and the ESP8266's 3.3V logic.
* **Relay:** The relay acts as the switch to trigger the gate motor's movement.

Only three connections need to be made to the D5 Evo Gate Motor:
1. Trig: this needs to be connected to ground for the gate to activate. I have connected this to a relay controlled by the ESP8266
2. Status: this needs to be logic-level-converted from 5V to 3.3V. Connect to a GPIO pin of the ESP8266
3. Com (ground, 0V): this is important for two reason: (1) status decoding and (2) triggering (activating) the gate. Because of (1), **the gate must share a ground with the ESP8266**.
